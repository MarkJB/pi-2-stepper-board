<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my Pi HAT* drawing machine add-on board for the Raspberry Pi 2 (and later).
=======
This is my vPiP Raspberry Pi 2/3 Add-on board especially for Pi day. vPiP (vertical Pi Plotter) is polargraph style, hanging v plotter.
>>>>>>> origin/master

It can drive 2 stepper motors and a servo, has provision for end stop switches and both I2C and SPI peripherals.

Designed for use with vPiP (https://github.com/brianinnes/vpip). vPiP is a Python based vertical hanging plotter control software.

This board is a work in progress and is currently untested.

vPiP is as yet unreleased. More information as it becomes available.

I wouldn't bother making one yet...
