###This is my Pi drawing machine add-on board for the Raspberry Pi 2 (and later).

It can drive 2 stepper motors and a servo, has provision for end stop switches and both I2C and SPI peripherals.

Designed for use with vPiP (https://github.com/brianinnes/vpip). vPiP is a Python based vertical hanging plotter control software.

This board is a work in progress and is currently untested.

vPiP is as yet unreleased. More information as it becomes available.

I wouldn't bother making one yet...
